# CharacterRecognition
Java framework for simple optical character recognition tasks.

Currently built around Chars74K English letters and digits dataset, with some MNIST support. Initial work
uses feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer. Current efforts have achieved ~90% classification
accuracy on ~10,000 unique digit images, notably with training time <30mins.

Future plans include support for various network architectures, especially convolutional NNs,
as well as diverse image data sets.
